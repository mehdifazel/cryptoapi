# Crypto API - Project Rules

## Stack
- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **TypeScript**. Run: `npm run dev` (local), `npm run build` then `npm start` (production).
- **No CORS proxy** (allorigins, cors-anywhere, etc.). Wallex and Ramzinex are proxied via Next.js API routes (`app/api/wallex`, `app/api/ramzinex`); Nobitex is called directly.

## Architecture
- **Modular**: Shared code in `lib/shared/`, exchange-specific in `lib/nobitex/`, `lib/wallex/`, `lib/ramzinex/`. Single UI in `components/ExchangePrices.tsx` with adapters in `lib/adapters.ts`.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies (next, react, typescript).

## Key Paths
- `app/` - Pages (home, nobitex, wallex, ramzinex, withdraw-networks) and API routes
- `lib/shared/` - utils, tv-api, network-db
- `lib/*/api.ts` - Exchange API clients (Nobitex direct, Wallex/Ramzinex via /api/*)
- `public/data/nobitex-withdraw-networks.json` - Withdraw networks (optional; run `scripts/build-withdraw-db.ps1` then copy to `public/data/` to update)
